Installation
============

Stable release
--------------

To install Contributors, run this command in your terminal:

``` {.console}
$ pip install contributors
```

This is the preferred method to install Contributors, as it will always
install the most recent stable release.

If you don\'t have [pip] installed, this [Python installation guide] can
guide you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for Contributors can be downloaded from the [Github repo].

You can either clone the public repository:

``` {.console}
$ git clone git://github.com/pydanny/contributors
```

Or download the [tarball][]:

``` {.console}
$ curl  -OL https://github.com/pydanny/contributors/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

``` {.console}
$ python setup.py install
```
